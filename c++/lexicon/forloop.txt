Forloop

A forloop goes hand in hand with an array.
One of its main uses is to walk through an array.
for example lets say that i create an array of integers, and this particular array has 100 items. that would be terrible to have to write a line to get each item.

eg
array[0]
array[1]
array[2]
array[3]
...

as opposed to this
for(int i = 0; i < 100; i++){
  array[i]
}

the second will take the the same amount of lines no matter what, where as the first one will always equal one line per item.
