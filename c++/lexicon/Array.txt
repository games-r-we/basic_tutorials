Array
An Array is a container, generally for similar items.
Think of it as an Egg Carton where the container is the array and the eggs are the items within the array.

Note In Computer Science everthing starts at 0.
for example it an array has 3 elements the first will be at spot 0 and the third element will be at spot 2.

array[0] = 1st element;
array[1] = 2nd element;
array[2] = 3rd element;


This is an example about how to create an array in c++
int [] carton = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12};
this will create an array with 12 elements. and put an element in each spot.

carton[0]  = 1;
carton[1]  = 2;
carton[2]  = 3;
carton[3]  = 4;
carton[4]  = 5;
carton[5]  = 6;
carton[6]  = 7;
carton[7]  = 8;
carton[8]  = 9;
carton[9]  = 10;
carton[10] = 11;
carton[11] = 12;
// it is null because spot 12 would be the 13th element which does not exsist because there are only 12 elements.
carton[12] = null;

// this just creates an empty array with 12 spots 
int [12] carton;
so carton[0]  equals 1.
so carton[1]  equals 2.
so carton[2]  equals 3.
so carton[3]  equals 4.
so carton[4]  equals 5.
so carton[5]  equals 6.
so carton[6]  equals 7.
so carton[7]  equals 8.
so carton[8]  equals 9.
so carton[9]  equals 10.
so carton[10] equals 11.
so carton[11] equals 12.
