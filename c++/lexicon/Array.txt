Array
An Array is a container, generally for similar items.
Think of it as an Egg Carton where the container is the array and the eggs are the items within the array.

Example
int [] carton = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12};

this is an array of integers. it has 12 spots
so carton[0] equals 1.
so carton[1] equals 2.
so carton[2] equals 3.

carton[12] equals null;
note that the arrays start at spot 0.
